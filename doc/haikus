  Recently learned how to use GNU parallel (from ChatGPT, no less!) and I've gone mad with power

  gnu parallel is actually like. really easy

  i really didn't expect it to be as simple as it is, took me all of 5 minutes to implement and the results are exactly what i wanted
  
  gnu parallel babey, it's really simple actually lol

  I've learned a lot during my internship, but getting even slightly more proficient with GNU parallel is probably the most important thing I've learned...
    -- Elijah Rippeth @terrible_coder@twitter

  I honestly don't know how I'd survive without @Docker and @GNU_Parallel
    -- Eric Pauley @EricPauley_@twitter

  Gnu parallel is indeed slick. I always try to align my data to make it possible to loop over it with a nice for loop added in a call to run the jobs in parallel then becomes super easy. I love the {1..99} syntax in bash.

  xargs諦めてGNU Parallel使ったら一瞬で問題が解決したので終わり
    -- aria_moto @moto_aria@twitter

  Such a life saver of a tool.
    -- winrid@ycombinator
  
  I used GNU Parallel to run a script locally that did what a big distributed system did, quicker and more reliably. It got to the point where people would just ask me to "run the thing" on my laptop instead of waiting for the cron.

    -- びーる @debugordie@twitter

  Igual @GnuParallel te puede echar una mano. Te permite pensar y
  programar en serie pero ejecutar en paralelo usando cores de una
  máquina o máquinas remotas. Una vez que lo has usando te lamentas no
  haberlo conocido antes :)

  If I could only keep 5 GNU utils, parallel would make it to the list

  @GnuParallel the best thing ever and it's not up for debate #EOchat
    -- Nathan Thomas @DrNASApants@twitter

  Using [GNU Parallel is] super easy if you use xargs, and it is magic for making things multi-process. Then adding in the ssh magic it can do it is an incredible tool that is completely underutilized.
     -- Ancients @Ancients@twitter

  GNU Parallel is one of the most helpful tools I've been using recently, and it's just something like: parallel -j4 'gzip {}' ::: folder/*.csv
     -- Milton Pividori @miltondp@twitter

  This is a fantastic tool, and I wish I had upgraded from xargs years ago!
    -- Stuart Anderson

  GNU Parallel and ripgrep would be your friend here.

  I have gotten a *ton* of mileage out of jq, awk, and GNU parallel,
  even at multi-GB sizes.
    -- Eric Wolak @ericthewolak@twitter 

GNU parallel, which works a little bit like xargs, but has a much more friendly way of handling files with spaces and automatically parallelises calls. This tool has saved me a great deal of coding because it makes it so easy to write a program which does just one part of a task and then run it in parallel with load balancing and a nice progress bar. I cannot recommend this tool enough.

  My new favourite command line tool is GNU Parallel. After knowing it for a while I just recently came back to it for a refactor of a script and now I've changed like 4 different huge scripts into tiny parallel scripts that do their job literally 3 to 10 times faster and just [mind blown]
