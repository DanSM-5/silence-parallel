Subject: GNU Parallel 20100722 released

GNU Parallel 20100722 has been released. It is available for
download at: http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/parallel/

New in this release:

* Counting semaphore functionality: start a job in the background. If
  N jobs are already running, wait for one to complete.

* With --colsep a table can be used as input. Example:
  cat tab_sep_table | parallel --colsep '\t' echo col1 {1} col2 {2}

* --trim can remove white space around arguments.

* --sshloginfile '..' means use ~/.parallel/sshloginfile

* Zero install package. Thanks to Tim Cuthbertson <tim3d dot junk at
  gmail dot com>

* OpenSUSE package. Thanks to Markus Ammer <mkmm at gmx-topmail dot
  de>

* NixOS package. Thanks to Ludovic Courtès <ludo at gnu dot org>

* Web review http://oentend.blogspot.com/2010/08/gnu-parallel.html

= About GNU Parallel =

GNU Parallel is a shell tool for executing jobs in parallel using one
or more machines. A job is typically a single command or a small
script that has to be run for each of the lines in the input. The
typical input is a list of files, a list of hosts, a list of users, a
list of URLs, or a list of tables.

If you use xargs today you will find GNU Parallel very easy to use as
GNU Parallel is written to have the same options as xargs. If you
write loops in shell, you will find GNU Parallel may be able to
replace most of the loops and make them run faster by running several
jobs in parallel. If you use ppss or pexec you will find GNU Parallel
will often make the command easier to read.

GNU Parallel makes sure output from the commands is the same output as
you would get had you run the commands sequentially. This makes it
possible to use output from GNU Parallel as input for other programs.
