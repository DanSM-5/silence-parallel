<h1>Debian parallel package - Applications manuals index</h1>

<h2><a href="parallel.html">parallel</a></h2>

<p>GNU <strong>parallel</strong> is a shell tool for executing jobs 
concurrently locally or using remote computers. A job is typically a 
single command or a small script that has to be run for each of the 
lines in the input. The typical input is a list of files, a list of 
hosts, a list of users, a list of URLs, or a list of tables.</p>

<h2><a href="sem.html">sem</a></h2>

<p>GNU <strong>sem</strong> is an alias for GNU <strong>parallel 
--semaphore</strong>.</p>
<p>It works as a tool for executing shell commands in parallel. GNU
<strong>sem</strong> acts as a counting semaphore. When GNU 
<strong>sem</strong> is called with command it will start the command 
in the background. When <em>num</em> number of commands are running in 
the background, GNU <strong>sem</strong> will wait for one of these to 
complete before starting another command.</p>

<h2><a href="sql.html">sql</a></h2>

<p>GNU <strong>sql</strong>  aims to give a simple, unified interface 
for accessing databases through all the different databases' command 
line clients. The database is addressed using a DBURL. If <em>commands</em> 
are left out you will get that database's interactive shell.</p>
<p>GNU <strong>sql</strong> is often used in combination with GNU 
<strong>parallel</strong>.</p>

<h2><a href="niceload.html">niceload</a></h2>

<p>GNU <strong>niceload</strong> will run a program when the load average 
is below a certain limit. When the limit is reached the program will be 
suspended for some time. Then resumed again for some time.  Then the load
average is checked again and we start over.</p>
