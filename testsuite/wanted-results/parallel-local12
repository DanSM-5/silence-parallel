### Test stdin goes to first command only ("cat" as argument)

Academic tradition requires you to cite works you base your article on.
If you use programs that use GNU Parallel to process data for an article in a
scientific publication, please cite:

  O. Tange (2011): GNU Parallel - The Command-Line Power Tool,
  ;login: The USENIX Magazine, February 2011:42-47.

This helps funding further development; AND IT WON'T COST YOU A CENT.
If you pay 10000 EUR you should feel free to use GNU Parallel without citing.

To silence this citation notice: run 'parallel --citation'.

### Test stdin as tty input for 'vi'
NB: If this changes and the diff is printed to terminal, then
the terminal settings may be fucked up. Use 'reset' to get back.
