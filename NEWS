* New video showing the new options.

* 100% options complete with xargs. All options for xargs can now be
  used in GNU Parallel - even the more exotic.

* --basefile for transferring basedata. When running jobs on remote
  computers --basefile will transfer files before the first jobs is
  run. It can be used to transfer data that remains the same for each
  job such as scripts or lookup tables.

* --progress shows progress. To see how many jobs is running on each
  server use --progress. It can be turned on even after GNU Parallel
  is started.

* --eta shows estimated time left in seconds.

* --halt-on-error stops if an error occurs. GNU Parallel will default
  to run all jobs - even if some of them fail. With --halt-on-error
  GNU Parallel can ignore errors, wait for the currently running jobs
  to finish, or stop immediately when an error occurs.
